# Expense-Tracking-App

The Expense Tracker is a Python-based command-line application designed to help users manage and track their expenses efficiently. The application allows users to record their expenses, categorize them, view summaries of their spending habits, set monthly savings goals, and export their expense data for further analysis.

Users can add a new expense by entering the name, amount, and selecting a category. The expense is automatically recorded with the current date.

Users can view a summary of their expenses, including total spending, spending by category, remaining budget, and daily budget for the rest of the month. The summary also includes visualizations such as pie charts and line graphs.
Set Monthly Savings Goal: Users can set a monthly savings goal, which adjusts their budget accordingly.
Export Expenses: Users can export their recorded expenses to a CSV file for backup or external analysis.
User-Friendly Interface: The application provides a simple and intuitive command-line interface with clear prompts and feedback.
